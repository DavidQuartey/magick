\description{
Graphics device that produces a Magick image type. Works like other graphics
devices but instead of writing to a file, the drawings get written to a magick
image object which can then be treated like any other image object.
}
\details{
The device is a relatively recent feature of the package. It should support all
operations but there might still be small inaccuracies. Also it is currently a
bit slow, probably because it is rendering too frequently. Perhaps the next
version will use lazy rendering.

\examples{
img <- magick_device()
