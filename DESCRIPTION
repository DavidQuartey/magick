Description: Bindings to ImageMagick: the most comprehensive open-source image
    processing library available. Supports many common formats (png, jpeg, tiff,
    pdf, etc) and manipulations (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip, blur, etc).
    All operations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate either
    on a single frame or a series of frames for working with layers, collages,
    video, or animation. Images are automatically previewed when printed to the
    console in RStudio or any X11 GUI, creating a fully interactive environment.
